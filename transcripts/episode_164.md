## Episode 164

Ben Felix: This is The Rational Reminder Podcast, a weekly reality check on sensible investing and financial decision-making for Canadians. We are hosted by me, Benjamin Felix and Cameron Passmore, portfolio managers at PWL Capital.

Cameron Passmore: This week, coming to life as a great idea that you had, which is something that we pulled together, that you pulled together, focusing on a single topic. So tell us where the idea came from.

Ben Felix: Well, we've done lots of episodes where you and I focus on a single topic, but we've also had lots of conversations with experts on various topics. But one of the concerns that I have as the library of our content increases is that if somebody wants to reference the podcast to learn about a topic, like if they want to learn about the 4% rule, which is what we're going to talk about in this episode, it's dispersed across many, many episodes. So we've produced all of this high quality, we think anyway, information in conversation with some of the world's leading experts on various topics. But if you want to learn about one of those topics, it's not so easy to index the content to do so.

Cameron Passmore: It isn't. And also, when you go through the pieces that you pull together, the audio clip that you pull together, the story really becomes richer when you put it all together, because they often add different ideas to someone else's ideas.

Ben Felix: Yeah. So we haven't explained the format. This new format that we're piloting, we'll explain what it is. So we've taken, like I mentioned for the 4% rule, we've taken that topic and we've gone through all of our existing catalog of content and said, "Who have we had the most meaningful, impactful conversations with on the specific topic of the 4% rule?" And then we've compiled those together into a single episode with additional commentary from you and I in between each clip. And our hope is to do this for other topics in the future, this just being the first one. We've experimented with different formats a couple times as we've progressed with the podcast, and this is our first new experiment in quite a while, so we do hope that people find it useful.

Cameron Passmore: It's kind of like our review episodes that we've done a couple times, but we are going to skip this week sort of book review, news of the week, other investment topics as well as bad advice of the week. So this is a standalone, and others in the future will be standalone on single topics.

Ben Felix: Yep. All right. So should we jump into the first comprehensive overview episode as we're calling them?

Cameron Passmore: Let's go.

Ben Felix: Welcome to Episode 164 of The Rational Reminder Podcast. Today we're doing a comprehensive overview of the 4% rule. So this is a spending rule that we've talked about with, I mean, the world's leading experts on the topic. We've talked to Bill Bengen who created the 4% rule. So I mean, who better to explain what it is?

Cameron Passmore: Literally.

Ben Felix: Literally, the guy. Yeah. We've talked to Wade Pfau, who's one of the world's leading retirement researchers. He's a professor of Retirement Income at The American College of Financial Services. We've talked Moshe Milevsky about the 4% rule. He teaches undergrad, graduate and doctoral students courses on wealth management, investments, insurance, pensions and retirement planning at York University, and he's written a ton of books on retirement income.

Cameron Passmore: Great books. Must-read books.

BenFelix: Yeah, great books. And his thoughts on the 4% rule were fantastic. We talked to Michael Kitces, who's the Head of Planning Strategy at Buckingham, which is a large wealth management firm in the United States. Fred Vettese, who's a former actuary and the author of multiple books on retirement income. And to balance it all out, we had a conversation with Scott Rieckens, who is the creator of the documentary, Playing with Fire. So I mean, when you think about, "Okay, I want to sit down and learn about the 4% rule," I cannot imagine anybody else that you would maybe add to that roster to make it better. Maybe Big Ern, the guy that writes the Early Retirement Now blog. He could be in this roster, too.

But I think what we have is pretty great. So to start, because we haven't explained what it is yet, to explain what the 4% rule is, we're going to go to a clip from our conversation with Bill Bengen, who again, is the creator of the 4% rule. I can't think of anyone better to describe what the 4% rule is.

Cameron Passmore: He was such a nice guy too. 

Cameron Passmore: Okay. So Bengen modeled withdrawals starting as a percentage of the portfolio, and then increasing with inflation each year, so the result being a constant inflation-adjusted spending. And then he tested withdrawals starting each calendar year from '26 to 1976, for 50 years, and observed how long the portfolio lasted at each starting point. So for a 30-year portfolio, half stock, half bonds, he found that the 4% withdrawal rate was always sustainable. So that's the key takeaway.

Ben Felix: Yeah. And then, when Bengen came out with his paper, there was another paper in 1998, Retirement Savings: Choosing a Withdrawal Rate That Is Sustainable, by Cooley, Hubbard and Walz. And that paper is commonly referred to in the Financial Independence, Retire Early community as the Trinity Study. And so these two papers together kind of solidified this concept that 4% is a safe withdrawal rate. And the Trinity Study is where people get the idea that 4% was safe 95% of the time in the historical data.

Now there are some really important points that I've expressed in YouTube videos and on our podcast regarding the 4% rule. It's based in Bengen's research on a 30-year withdrawal period, and it's in the historical data. It's based on a 30 to 65 year old investor, and then Bengen said that he added roughly 10 years on to normal life expectancy to account for longevity risk. But the key here, we're talking about a 30-year withdrawal period. And particularly when we're talking about early retirees, it's probably hopefully going to be longer than a 30-year withdrawal. If you extend that period, so say we looked at 40-year periods for withdrawals, repeating the 4% rule as it was originally analyzed, the success rate drops to around 87%.

Cameron Passmore: Which is fascinating. It's kind of counterintuitive.

Ben Felix: Why?

Cameron Passmore: Just because you think longer periods of time smooths out more of the bumps, but the success rate goes down in longer periods of time. Everyone's told, "Have an investment horizon that's a long period of time. Be patient."

Ben Felix: Your returns might even out. You might be more likely to get the average return over a longer period of time, but I think that the challenge is with the sequence of returns, which is one of the things that the whole concept of the 4% rule, and what is the safe withdrawal rate, answering that question started with. Well, just nobody knew. Nobody had tested empirically. And you didn't know based on the sequence of returns that you were going to get, you didn't know how much you could actually spend. So that's why this was a breakthrough. And when we talked to Bill Bengen, he explained to us why he thought it became so popular. But there are definitely still shortcomings.

And so anyway, I mentioned some of the issues. There are other ones like the fact that this uses US data when there are many other countries in the world that have also had stock return histories. Where I got that information, like when I did my YouTube videos on this topic, it all came from reading one of Wade Pfau's books on retirement spending, where he picked apart the 4% rule. And he was actually one of the first person to publish research using international data to say, "Hey, this thing hasn't actually worked if you look pretty much anywhere except for the US and Canada and New Zealand, are the only ones where it did work." So we're going to now play a clip from our conversation with Wade Pfau to talk about some of the issues around the 4% rule.

Ben Felix: So that information from Wade Pfau, in my mind kills the 4% rule. And it did. Like when I first read Wade's book, like I mentioned before, it was like, "Okay. Well, there's no counter argument that I can think of. And why would you only look at a 30-year retirement period, using only US stocks to conclude that this is a safe withdrawal rate, while ignoring the international data?"

Cameron Passmore: There's also the question of whether things are different today, high stock valuations, low bond yields. I mean, it's a whole different era than the time period that Bill looked at. So this is exactly what we talked to Fred Vettese about. 

Cameron Passmore: Okay. So Fred alluded to an important concept that the 4% rule doesn't address, which was Bengen's research was based on these constant inflation-adjusted withdrawals, which may not make a whole lot of sense. So of course, for those who listened to that episode, we talked to Moshe Milevsky, about the importance of having flexibility in retirement spending. I think it was one of the most perhaps challenging times that we've ever had in an interview.

Ben Felix: Moshe was tough. And for anybody wondering, yes, I did feel like a child when Professor Milevsky was questioning me about the 4% rule.

Cameron Passmore: He was so good. So pointed on that point, this is such a great part of that interview. 

Cameron Passmore: Well, that was certainly clear from Moshe, wasn't it?

Ben Felix: He definitely knows how to get his point across. Now on variable spending strategies, that is one of the things that we spoke extensively to Michael Kitces about. So we're going to go to a clip with him where he talks about some of the other strategies other than constant inflation-adjusted spending that retirees may want to consider. 

Cameron Passmore: So I think the idea of bumpers is super interesting, and I thought that was a great analogy from Michael. But the interesting thing about this, and we talk about this a lot with clients approaching or in retirement, is that you need to have a very refined awareness of what you need monthly for cash flow to make ends meet. A lot of people just don't have that awareness. And to have that awareness, then how much margin around that would you want to spend if you do have great returns in your portfolio? But part of the spending that is irregular are things in your, how to keep your house, perhaps, or a new vehicle.

So you really have to be aware of, if you're at the lower end of your spending amount because the bumper put you that way, what when things return to normal or your portfolio improves, do you need to allocate for the new roof on your house or your new furnace, as opposed to other discretionary type spending. So I think it's an interesting need for people to understand exactly what spending needs they have.

Ben Felix: Right. All right, so we've picked apart the 4% rule, we've kind of explained what it is, knocked it down, stripped it apart from a few different angles. And we've offered up variable spending strategies, which as Professor Milevsky pointed out, are probably more sensible than trying to find a single number safe withdrawal rate. Now, to be fair to the Financial Independence, Retire Early community who tend to sort of champion this rule, we spoke to Scott Rieckens who, I mean, I think speaks at least to an extent for the early retirement community. He certainly created an excellent movie about it. So he talked to us about how he thinks the 4% rule should be used and how it is used in practice.

Ben Felix: All right. So it's good to hear from somebody that's on the early retirement path, they're not using this as a rule, it's more of a guideline. That's reassuring to hear. From reading conversations online, I don't know if that's always well understood and that's definitely one of the points that we do want to get across. Now, we have picked apart the 4% rule. But we also did talk to Bill Bengen about longer withdrawal periods. We talked to him about non-US data, and we talked to him about other cases where in his opinion, the 4% rule may not hold. In these clips, Bill is going to refer to the 4.5% rule, which we'll address coming up in a clip further down.

Cameron Passmore: I'm so glad we got to ask Bill about the cost. This is something that ever since I heard for the first time the 4% rule, I wondered, "Are costs really included in that?" And so it's nice to get him on the record about the impact of costs on your success rate.

Ben Felix: Yeah, for sure. Now, Bill talked about the 4.5% rule there and some people's ears may have perked up because this episode is about the 4% rule. There are some interesting points that Bill makes around including other types of stocks. So in his original analysis, he was looking at US large caps, but later he extended that to include small caps, and it actually changed his findings.

Ben Felix: Now, this concept of adding in small caps to market cap weights can be pushed even further, which is something that we've looked at and Bill's looked at too, we found in our analysis that a 50-year safe withdrawal rate using small cap value stocks, US small cap value stocks, was 3.6% compared to 3.1% for just US total stock market in historical data. We asked Bill about his findings and whether he would recommend that type of portfolio for a retiree.

Ben Felix: So it's possible that the 4% rule can be saved with a heavier loading to small cap value stocks. The other thing that Bill explained is that in his most recent research, he's sorted the US data by CAPE, by cyclically adjusted price-earnings, and inflation regimes to find safe withdrawal rates within those different regimes. So we've covered our thoughts on CAPE in past episodes of this podcast, and its lack of a real usefulness and making asset allocation and spending decisions. And the research that Bill is going to talk about does suffer from the same hindsight bias that we've talked about, because it sorts time periods by CAPE ranked relative to the full historical sample of historical CAPEs. It's a problem because we have no idea how that historical record compares to future CAPEs, which is what actually matters ex-ante. But nonetheless, the research that Bill did on this is absolutely fascinating.

Ben Felix: So international data, longer time periods, killed the 4% rule, but we may be able to revive it using tilts towards small cap value, if you really want to get to that 4% number or get closer to it. Low expected returns might have killed the 4% rule, but at least in the US historical data, low inflation could more than offset that if we continue to have low inflation, which is a big question on a lot of people's minds.

Cameron Passmore: No kidding.

Ben Felix: But I think that even the bigger point that people should be thinking about is that we shouldn't really even be having this conversation about fixed withdrawal rates, because trying to withdraw a constant inflation-adjusted amount from a portfolio of risky volatile assets is kind of ridiculous. And again, Moshe made that point kind of at my expense.

Cameron Passmore: Well, he was practically speaking, he's dead on. You have to have that flexibility.

Ben Felix: Absolutely. Absolutely.

Cameron Passmore: That to me is the key takeaway from this whole discussion. I mean, the whole 4% rule, I remember when I first heard about it, in my experience back when I first heard about it, it got people to reduce how much they thought they could spend. Because a lot of people were thinking like, "It's been 5%, 8%, they weren't taking account how much you had to leave in the kitty for inflation. So I think the whole notion is a good thing and brought people to something that's more reasonable in terms of expectations. Most people back then weren't thinking about protecting for inflation, necessarily, and weren't really appreciating the randomness. That's the good part about the 4% rule.

Ben Felix: And it's interesting if it takes people down from 8%, then yeah, I agree. I agree with what you said. And we heard Scott Rieckens talk about this too, that if this is something that anchors people and allows them to think long-term and make decisions and reduce their spending and put money into savings, because it's easy to think about, that's awesome. If it's being used as a guideline like that, I still think that the number deserves careful thought. It's probably not possible to narrow it down to a single number to use in real financial planning, but if you're going to use a number to help make decisions, sort of as a heuristic, I think it's probably lower than 4% unless you're really juicing up the small cap value. But as we heard Bill talk about, that's probably not sensible for most people to do.

Cameron Passmore: You got to have good behavior and stay committed to your factors.

Ben Felix: And it's probably higher than 2% probably. Like when I've run this in Monte Carlo, which gives us a different type of insight than using historical analysis, using current relatively low expected returns, I've found around that 2% number even for long, like very long retirement periods. But you could also argue that's low because relative to the historical data, the Monte Carlo completely ignores any mean reversion, although we probably shouldn't bet on mean reversion happening again in the future. Anyway, I think somewhere between higher than two probably, and lower than 4% if somebody is going to be using a safe withdrawal estimate. And of course, it depends on other things like taxes and time horizon and asset allocation.

Cameron Passmore: It's also spending, right? Like a lot of people that we work with that are retired, they don't go and take out the whatever 2% increase every year. Often they've set it at pick a dollar amount, 5000 a month, and here we are five or 10 years later, it's still $5,000 a month they're taking. So I don't know if they're like Michael Kitces is talked about eliminating permanent spending on certain items. Could be that going on? Could be just their spending pattern drifts down over time, which is what Fred Vettese talked about in our interview with him, just a natural spending pattern that combats inflation as you get older.

Ben Felix: Yeah. There's so many different ways to slice it and think about this retirement income problem. And this hasn't even spoken to different product allocations, like using annuities later on.

Cameron Passmore: Good point.

Ben Felix: Yeah. I mean, there's so many things that goes into it. So to summarize, I think as a guideline, like we've mentioned, if using something like this is going to help somebody who doesn't have access to sophisticated financial planning software, make quick decisions or long-term decisions, I think that's great. I'd maybe be using something lower than 4%, though. But anyway, we hope that this consolidation of portions of interviews with experts on this topic has helped define what the 4% rule is, and provide context around when it is maybe useful, when it maybe isn't useful, how it should maybe be adjusted, and maybe even more broadly, how people should be thinking about retirement spending.

Cameron Passmore: Agree. And with that, thanks for listening.
