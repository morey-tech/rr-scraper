## Episode 269

Ben Felix: This is the Rational Reminder Podcast, a weekly reality check on sensible investing and financial decision-making from two Canadians. We're hosted by me, Benjamin Felix and Cameron Passmore, portfolio managers at PWL Capital.

Cameron Passmore: Welcome to episode 269. This week, Ben, we have a blockbuster episode. What a great line up. We kick it off first, we welcome back a good friend of ours, Preet Banerjee, or I should say, Dr. Preet Banerjee. For those who remember, he was on a few years ago. We talked about his upcoming doctorate work, and he's actually made it through his dissertation. He'll join us to talk about a multi-dimensional analysis of the value of financial advice to households in Canada. Fabulous conversation.

Ben Felix: Oh, yeah. Nicely done research. It's his dissertation, which he just defended vigorously as he explains to us at the end of the conversation. I really do think that he's done some research that is currently and will continue to be useful for how the industry, the financial services industry thinks about advice and also, how households think about what type of advice they should be seeking. Anyway, we dig deep into those details with Preet and what I think was a fascinating discussion.

Cameron Passmore: But after that, our colleague, Mark McGrath will join us for his regular segment, which will now be called Mark to Market. We'll take a look back at one of my personal favourite episodes, when Colonel Chris Hadfield joined us last year. For the book review this week, we'll take a look at a book that I devoured while on the dock a few weeks ago on vacation. It's called Excellent Advice for Living: Wisdom I Wish I'd Known Earlier by Kevin Kelly. Of course, at the end, we've got our after show.

Ben Felix: I do want to mention quickly because talking about these webinars has proved to be a success. People listen to the podcast. Who knew? When we mention the upcoming webinars, a lot of people are going and signing up, which is pretty cool to see, honestly. The next webinar coming up is on September 27th at noon Eastern Time. The topic for this one is finding and funding a good life, which is a topic that we've, of course, talked a lot about on the podcast. I've seen a version of this webinar and it's really, really good content that I think is going to be useful to a lot of people.

For the last webinar that we mentioned on the podcast, the one on employee equity compensation, I think it was called What Are My Options With My Options? Clever title. A 110 people signed up for that one. Again, I mean, that's just cool to see. A large portion of those were people who signed up through listening to our podcast, but they were, I think, from social media posts and stuff like that, other people signed up. Great to see. I think the content of these webinars has been great. I've been checking them out myself. I also think it's a useful opportunity to meet the PWL team, beyond me and Cameron. People listen to our podcast, but there's a huge team behind us. They've got lots of things to say that we haven't said, or haven't thought about, so I think it's worth hearing from them.

It's also just neat to see that a lot of new clients that have come on board to PWL in the recent past since we've started doing these webinars are coming to the firm already being familiar with the team outside of Cameron and I, because they've been attending these webinars. I think the webinars are great. Next one, September 27th on finding and funding a good life.

Cameron Passmore: Great setup. With that, let's go to our episode.
