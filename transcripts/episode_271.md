Cameron Passmore:  Welcome to episode 271. This week's episode is jam-packed once again. Can't wait, Ben, for you to dive into your topic off the top, which is all about AI. So many conversations now, both at work and with friends at home, are about AI. This breakthrough technology might not necessarily mean higher expected returns, or am I stealing your punchline?

Ben Felix: Yeah, you stole it. That's okay. I'll give the details.

Cameron Passmore: I'm sure there'll be no surprise to anybody. This week's segment, Mark to Market, our colleague, Mark McGrath, will share his thoughts on being a landlord. For the book segment this week, we take a look at another excellent personal finance book that I came across in LinkedIn called People Are Lying to You About Money. The author, Anthony Walsh, will join us from Germany. Good conversation.

We'll look back at episode 155 with our good friend Don Ezra, who had an interesting perspective on preparing for retirement, or as he calls it, Life Two. Of course, we have the after show for our three die-hard listeners.

Ben Felix:  We do have a couple of webinars that I want to mention coming up on September 27th. We've got a webinar on finding and funding a good life. Also, on October 4th, we've got another one coming up on Saving Your Retirement: Dangers That Could Drain Your Investment Account. Very catchy title. I'm sure they'll both be great webinars put on by the PWL team, and we'll put sign-up links in the show notes for the episode.

Cameron Passmore:   If you want to keep track of those future dates, you can follow any one of our various online social media accounts. I thought I'd highlight a conversation I had with a new listener to the podcast recently. He's a friend of mine, and he had no idea. He said to me, he said, I had no idea that it was that good.” He didn't know we had one. He said, “I can't stop listening to it. I'm completely hooked to it.” He's told a few of his friends about it, and they're really interested as well.

I said, what is it about it that you find interesting? Because we often debate here how long and how technical should these be. He just loves the full-length discussion that we have, where no rush to get through topics. He appreciates that. He also highlighted that some of the deep dives that you do, like you’re into sometimes more than 20. For example, today's conversation, I think you have 23 different sources that you're citing. It was almost like, the least, he said, that one could do is spend half an hour, or 40 minutes listening to you, considering all the time you put into distilling all this research. I thought that was pretty cool.

Ben Felix: People don't owe me anything, just because I read a lot of stuff.

Cameron Passmore: I'm not saying on my Twitter feed, love Thursdays. I do love Thursdays. In 30, 40 minutes, or for your segment, or hour and 15 minutes, you can learn quite a bit. It seems like a reasonable investment of time for your economic future.

Ben Felix: I think so.

Cameron Passmore:  Anyways, all that to say, share this widely. I think the information is pretty good. Don't be shy of sharing it if you find value in it.

Ben Felix: Yeah, share it and tell us what you think. I think we said this in a recent episode, too, that it feels good to get comments, but it's also useful. It's good to get feedback. Sometimes we get more comments. Sometimes we get fewer comments, but it's always good. I think it's also good for the algorithm on YouTube and all that stuff. That's not why I'm asking. We just love to hear what people think about the episodes and it helps us think about where to go in the future, but it also gives us ideas about topics. It's really useful when you leave comments, even if it's just like the episode, or didn't like the episode.

Cameron Passmore:  I agree. All right, with that, let's head over to our episode.
