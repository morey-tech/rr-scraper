## Episode 272

Ben Felix: This is the Rational Reminder Podcast, a weekly reality check on sensible investing and financial decision-making from two Canadians. We're hosted by me, Benjamin Felix and Cameron Passmore, portfolio managers at PWL Capital.

Cameron Passmore: Welcome to Episode 272, and we welcome back a very good friend of the show, Globe and Mail writer, Rob Carrick. This week, we're going to talk about the state of Canadian personal finance. Rob is such a great guy, great experience, and talks to so many Canadians through his various media that he gets a real sense of what's going on in personal finance in Canadians. So it's great to have him back on. We just realized he was on 100 episodes ago in Episode 172, as well as Episode 39. Rob's a longtime writer, personal finance writer in The Globe and Mail. I've known Rob for well over 25 years, so it's super fun to have him back on.

Ben Felix:  Yes. I think he's 27 years doing personal finance at The Globe, something like that.

Cameron Passmore: Yes, sounded all right.

Ben Felix: He's been doing it for a long time, though. Like he's telling, Cameron, he's got a real boots-on-the-ground perspective, and he actually tells us during the conversation that he's got a survey that he sends out through his newsletter, and he'll ask questions. If he's getting a sense that maybe something's going on, but he's not seeing it yet in the economic data, and he's not seeing any publications about it, he can ask questions to his many thousands of readers, and he'll get many 1000s of responses back. So he's actually able to get, now, it's a biased sample which acknowledges. But even so, he's able to get insight, aggregated insight into how people are feeling about certain topics before that data is surfaced anywhere else, which I think is really interesting.

Cameron Passmore: So his personal finance column appears twice weekly in The Globe and Mail. He has a portfolio strategy column that runs on alternating Saturdays also in The Globe. He also has a twice-weekly email newsletter called Carrick on Money that he puts together, that accumulates the best personal finance and investing material that he's found online. He also co-hosts the popular podcast, Stress Test. Ben, anything else to add?

Ben Felix: That's a good introduction. Stress Test is a cool podcast, though. They talk to people, kind of like the survey thing that I mentioned. They talk to people about what's really going on in their lives, just regular Canadians. Yeah, it's a nice podcast. Anyway, I think that's a good introduction, so we'll go ahead to our conversation on the state of Canadian personal finance with Rob Carrick.
