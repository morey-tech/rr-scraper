## Episode 270

Ben Felix: This is the Rational Reminder Podcast, a weekly reality check on sensible investing and financial decision-making from two Canadians. We are hosted by me, Benjamin Felix, and Cameron Passmore. Portfolio managers at PWL Capital. 

Cameron Passmore: Welcome to episode 270. And this week we have a couple of authors and unbelievably experienced people in the finance profession join us. And what prompted it, Ben, was a book that just released, actually, called The Missing Billionaires: A Guide to Better Financial Decisions. And this is written by Victor Haghani and James White. 

For those who read the book When Genius Failed, you might recognize that first name, Victor Haghani. Was a partner at Long-Term Capital Management. But the point of the book is that, over the past century, if the wealthiest families had spent a reasonable fraction of their wealth, paid taxes, and invested in the stock market, there would be thousands of billionaires today. But there aren't. There's virtually none that came from a hundred years ago. And that inspired these guys to write this book as to how can you make better financial decisions. With that, Ben, why don't you tell the story of how we met Victor and James? 

Ben Felix: Yeah, sure. That's a good introduction to the book though. Where did all the billionaires go? And a lot of it is spending policy and sizing decisions on how much risk to take in your portfolio. But, yeah. How do we get connected with them? 

I knew who Victor was because I'd read When Genius Failed. It's a great book, a great story about Long-Term Capital Management. I knew him as this sort of character in that book. And then I was doing research on options for a video idea that I have, and he's got a paper. He's got a paper on what other options make sense in the portfolios of retail investors in The Journal of Derivatives, I think. I'm reading that paper. And I thought it was kind of cool that Victor had this paper because I knew who he was from the story. 

And then you and I both got a message from him on LinkedIn and he's saying that he enjoys our podcast and that he's got this book coming out and he'd love to come on to talk about it. And I'm like, "Victor Haghani? Is this the same guy that is in When Genius Failed and the same guy whose paper I'm reading right now?" And it was. 

Cameron Passmore: Who was a partner of Bob Merton.

Ben Felix: Right. At Long-Term Capital Management. Anyway, it was kind of a crazy thing. And it was just a crazy coincidence that I had his paper open when he sent us that message. And then they sent us the advanced copy of the book and started flipping through it. And on the praise on the cover of the book, you've got a note from John Campbell, Bob Merton. I thought I saw  in there somewhere too. 

Cameron Passmore: Yes. He's there. 

Ben Felix: And then you start – Myron Scholes, Michael Mauboussin. Yeah, just like pretty serious people to get praise from. And then start flipping through the content of the book and it's like, "Okay. Yeah, this is incredible." Because what they've done is they've taken pretty hardcore theory, expected utility theory, and packaged it up in a way that – I mean, personally, from reading their book, my understanding of expected utility and how it's useful and why it's important for making good financial decisions is on a whole different level. It's a tough topic. You see it all the time when you're reading papers and stuff like that. But really understanding why it's important and how it can be applied is not so easy. 

But anyway, they did a great job with that in the book. But it was pretty obvious, to me at least, once we've got a copy of the book and started flipping through it, that it made sense for them to be guests in the podcast. 

Cameron Passmore: And we get a couple of questions into Victor about his time at LTCM. 

Ben Felix: Yeah, which is just fascinating, right? That's the story. And James is no slouch either. His academic background is in math from the University of Chicago, but he's worked in finance for I think 20 years. But one of the ones that jumps out at me is that he spent time as a portfolio manager at Citadel, which is like I don't know what you'd call that. The MIT of hedge funds or something. I don't know. Not an easy place to get into.

Cameron Passmore: And they both work at Elm Wealth, which is a wealth advisory firm in the US. They're in the business, which is also interesting. Because they can apply what they're learning to real-life situations.

Ben Felix:Yep. Definitely. I mean – I don't know. Do we want to give any more background on who they are? 

Cameron Passmore:I think we've covered. I mean, Victor's been in the industry for over 40 years. Started at Solomon Brothers in '84. '93, joined Long-Term Capital Management. Had an incredible career in research since then. Co-founded Elm Wealth. James pretty much went through it. He's had positions in research trading, executive roles at Citadel and Bank of America. James is in Philly. Victor's in Wyoming. If you watch the video, you'll see Victor's got the quintessential Wyoming background in the video. But they're really good, interesting, really smart guys. It was a fun conversation. 

Ben Felix: Yeah, fun conversation. I think it's a worthwhile listen. And we hope people enjoy it. I think with that, we can go ahead to the episode with Victor Haghani and James White.
