## Episode 273

Ben Felix: This is the Rational Reminder Podcast, a weekly reality check on sensible investing and financial decision-making from two Canadians. We are hosted by me, Benjamin Felix and Cameron Passmore, portfolio managers at PWL Capital.

Cameron Passmore: Welcome to Episode 274. This week, we have a great guest. Really nice guy, too, Ben. Professor Samuel Hartzmark joined us. Sam's a professor in the Finance Department at Boston College's Carroll School of Management and he studies asset pricing and behavioural finance and absolutely fascinating, engaging, and really nice guy. With that, Ben, you've got to queue this up. These are great topics to talk about.

Ben Felix:  Yes. He's got tons of incredible papers, and I was familiar with a handful of them before we invited him on. Then afterwards, obviously, I read all the papers, at least the ones that we ask questions about. It was a paper on dividends that I was most familiar with, and then a more recent paper on sustainable investing that Sam came out with. I read that one and it was just so good. He does such a good job at really pulling apart topics in a way that is not intentional, I guess, but he brings you these counterintuitive conclusions with his research. I guess, he chooses topics that end up having really counterintuitive conclusions.

On sustainable investing, just a fascinating paper on the actual impact of changing the cost of capital of green and brown firms, like if we're trying to make the world a better place, is depriving brown firms of capital an efficient way to cause a green transition? Anyway, very counterintuitive finding. I won't spoil it. But after I read that paper, I was like, “Oh, we got to see if Sam will come on the podcast.” Then once I dug into his research, there's even more interesting stuff on sustainable investing on dividends. We spent a lot of time talking about those two topics, but then also, about the impact of price-only index returns and how that affects investor behaviour and how the media reports on markets.

Cameron Passmore: That's a subject I don't think we've talked about that bias before. It was really interesting.

Ben Felix: You know, it's a thing. I've had this conversation with people many times where they show me the returns of an index and they're like, “Why am I getting a different number than you?” It's like, well, you're looking at the price-only return. It's something that comes up for sure, but Sam's done incredible research on it.

 Then we finished with a discussion on multi-factor asset pricing, which was very interesting. It was last year that we spent a lot of time talking about the ICAPM model, and then of course, we've talked to Robert Merton, and we've talked to John Cochrane, we've talked to John Campbell about this risk story for multi-factor asset pricing. Sam has, again, I'm not going to spoil it, he's got a really, really interesting take on how to interpret those models and how realistic they are, given how people actually behave, or people actually think.

Cameron Passmore:Sam holds a Ph.D. from the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California. Also, has an MBA from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, and a BA in Mathematics Economics, with a double major in religion from Emory University. Anything, Ben, to add?

Ben Felix: No. I think it's a really, really cool episode. I hope people enjoy it. With that as the introduction, I think we can go ahead to our conversation with Professor Sam Hartzmark.
