## Episode 274

Ben Felix: This is the Rational Reminder Podcast, a weekly reality check on sensible investing and financial decision-making from two Canadians. We're hosted by me, Benjamin Felix, and Cameron Passmore, Portfolio Managers at PWL Capital. 

Cameron Passmore: Welcome to episode 274. This is a different kind of episode. And, honestly, Ben, it's kind of a different kind of season for us recording. We've been so busy travelling and doing a couple of live events. But today we get a chance to release the live event that we recorded in Toronto at the CFA Society Toronto's Annual Wealth Conference, which was fun. And we'll talk more about that in the actual episode. 

Mark McGrath of course will join us again for Mark to Market. And we get a chance to talk to Brittany Hodak, who wrote the excellent book Creating Superfans: How to Turn Your Customers into Lifelong Advocates. Of course, after that, we'll jump into the after-show. 

Anything else you want to tea up, Ben? 

Ben Felix: I think that's a pretty good introduction. It's definitely a unique episode. I mean, we'll talk more about it when we get into introducing the segment, but it was a unique experience for us. We recorded this thing live. And it was a little bit about what we've learned in the podcast and then a little bit about what we've learned about podcasting from doing the podcast. Anyway, we'll talk more about it in the episode.

Cameron Passmore:  All right. Let's go.
