## Episode 223

Ben Felix: This is the Rational Reminder Podcast, a weekly reality check on sensible investing and financial decision making from two Canadians. We’re hosted by me, Benjamin Felix and Cameron Passmore, portfolio managers at PWL Capital.

Cameron Passmore: This is Episode 223. Welcome, everybody to another episode. For those that are watching on YouTube, yes, I'm in my new home office setup. Same home, different office.

Ben Felix: I'm super jealous.

Cameron Passmore: Really?

Ben Felix: It looks very nice.

Cameron Passmore: Oh, it's all in the pot lights. These new pot lights that are out these days are unreal. 

Ben Felix: It looks great. Just having a nice little room, my setup’s – I won't tell you how crazy it is. It’s a strange one.

Cameron Passmore: Yeah. I got James' old bedroom, so he's on the other room now. I put in nice pot lights, and do some nice soundproofing on the back wall, so it will get better. But it's nice to be in my own room. Oscar is not crazy being up here though.

Ben Felix: No?

Cameron Passmore: So that's why you don’t see Oscar. No. So you know Ben, I'm a fan of habits, and completely agree with Katy Milkman and other guests who have said that, by saying you are something, you will do something, and become something. So as you know, I got a Peloton a long time ago, and just decided that I'm going to ride the Peloton every day that I'm home. So you don't have to debate which days of the week, you just do it. Anyway, tomorrow, Friday, when this drops, it will be last Friday. I’ll be doing my 1000th Peloton ride if you can believe it. 

Ben Felix: Wow. 

Cameron Passmore: I say that not for applause. Anybody can do it. It's just shows the power of doing something every single day when you're home, but the numbers just – I wasn't paying attention. All of a sudden, I get this email from Peloton saying it’s coming up. So I'm trying to do a live ride and maybe we'll get a shout out, which is kind of cool, and maybe some other – our listeners will be there. The other thing, you mentioned bundling in this episode. I don't listen to the trainer on Peloton anymore. I actually listen to a podcast, I'm bundling podcast listening with the free training experience, which is cool. Have you watched it on Netflix the new series called Eat the Rich: The GameStop Saga? 

Ben Felix: No.

Cameron Passmore: Are you going to watch it?

Ben Felix: Maybe.

Cameron Passmore: You're skeptical.

Ben Felix: No, I'm not skeptical. I don't think that my wife would be interested and I usually only watch Netflix for like the one hour that we're sitting together on the couch at night. 

Cameron Passmore: Okay, that's pretty good. Anyways, most people are aware of the whole GameStop Saga that happened in late 2020, that led to the massive rise in the price of GameStop shares. I've heard the story a number of times, like Barry. The author, Spencer Jakab, the guy from The Wall Street Journal who wrote the book, The Revolution That Wasn't. So I knew the story, but it didn't have a full appreciation like I think you do for WallStreetBets and the characters behind this. I didn't really connect as well to all that. Anyways, this whole thing comes to vibrant life in this very wacky little miniseries, three episodes, 35, 40 minutes each. It's funny, it's funk, it's interesting, it's accurate like how things happen. The timelines are very well explained. You learn about the character, Roaring Kitty. Do you know about Roaring Kitty?

Ben Felix: Oh, of course.

Cameron Passmore: Anyways, the whole thing is wacky. This groundswell that basically put the screws to hedge funds and cause the short squeeze, how short squeezes worth to do a very good job of explaining that. The role Robinhood played, when Robinhood disallowed their customers to buy more GameStop. What's the story behind that? And that links to Citadel, and that links to Melvin Capital, Elon Musk tweeting in the middle of it all, cause the price to go up even more. All these concepts are really, really well done. It's quite comical to watch like this Roaring Kitty is just this crazy character, and they show the video clips of him. The amount of money that was lost is wild, like $20 billion was lost in the squeeze.

Ben Felix: Insane.

Cameron Passmore: It's insane, but it's a pretty engaging, entertaining video of a pretty, crazy story.

Ben Felix: Does it talk about who came out on top?

Cameron Passmore: They have actual people in there who did make a fair chunk of cash. So they have real people, that like real Reddit, watchers that piled one of this and did make some money, yeah. There was a number of characters that they interview to the story.

Ben Felix: Interesting. That whole episode killed WallStreetBets. They used to be one of the subreddits they would go on every day.

Cameron Passmore: Oh, really?

Ben Felix: Because it was really interesting and funny. But then, the number of people, what are they called, members, whatever of the subreddit swelled. It was like well below a million. It was increasing, it was growing. Then, when this thing happened, it went up, I don't know, like six million or something, and then I just stopped, just stopped being interesting.

Cameron Passmore: So you went before the popularity hit?

Ben Felix: Yeah, because it's like super geeky finance humour, with a kind of edginess that I find funny.

Cameron Passmore: Then it just became this, bury the hedge funds.

Ben Felix: I couldn't tell you. I never go in there anymore.

Cameron Passmore: But were you there through the episode, like through the price taking off and people just buying whatever they could, buy more, and more, and more, and that coincided with Robinhood and ease of trading.

Ben Felix: Yeah.

Cameron Passmore: Wow. I didn't realize you're that active in there.

Ben Felix: I was active. I've read the post, but –

Cameron Passmore: Also me, but lurking.

Ben Felix: Yeah, lurking. Exactly. But at all, it changed the whole subreddit when all this stuff happened.

Cameron Passmore: So November is Financial Literacy Month in Canada. In the US, I didn't know this, April is Financial Literacy Month. But in Canada, it’s November. As you discuss back in episode 217, there's certainly a great need to increase our collective financial literacy. In November in the us episodes, we're going to be quickly reviewing 10 books that we think can help improve anyone's financial literacy. Then in the store, for Financial Literacy Month in the month of November, if you spend $30 in the store, you will get 50% off a deck of Talking Cents cards. The cards are already pretty affordable. Now, they're really affordable, and you get the free socks and koozie with it. I think Angelica is going to start the sale right away, and not wait for November 1st, but it goes until November 30th. The store can be found at rationalreminder.ca. I had someone reach out to me, Ben, on LinkedIn and ask for an update on the crypto series.

Ben Felix: Yeah. Well, I feel bad for kind of just letting it die without us saying anything in the last couple of episodes. We had one more guest lined up, and they ended up having to cancel, and then want to reschedule for some time in October. So we have not rescheduled yet. But the intention was to have that final episode, and then finish with one more episode with just us kind of summarizing everything. I still have to book that final guest, but then in the interim, I also found one more person that I want to talk to, two more actually. Two more, because there's one more guest and one – remember our very first episode in the crypto series was with a Rational Reminder listener who was a software engineer. He'd written about blockchains from a software engineer’s perspective, what they're actually useful for. He was our very first episode.

We have another Rational Reminder listener, who is also a software developer, and is working on like a theory and related projects. They're very much in the pro-crypto camp, but also a dedicated Rational Reminder listener. I think it will be interesting to talk with them in an episode to kind of get their take on the crypto series from that perspective, just to see if there are any kind of blind spots that – because we did have a lot of skeptical perspectives. I'd want to hear from somebody who's working in there. Like we kind of heard with Ari Juels, in the last episode that we did publish, that there's maybe a different perspective if you're working in the space than if you're looking at it from the outside in.

Anyway, so there are those two more guests, and then the one episode with a listener to kind of review the series, and then we will cap it off with an episode at the end. But all of this timeline is kind of uncertain right now, because I still have to book those last two guests. And I told the listener that I want to talk to them after we've published the final episode, but it's not dead. We will finish the series. It's just, things got a little shaken up because of the one guest cancellation and I haven't gotten it back on track yet.

Cameron Passmore: And we got a pretty busy fall.

Ben Felix: Yeah. 

Cameron Passmore: Speaking of crypto, and I didn't put this in the notes. But I watched that new feature film, I guess you could call it called Coin, which is basically a story of the Brian Armstrong story, the founder of Coinbase. I rented that on the weekend on YouTube, and it was $5 on YouTube, and I watched it. Did you watch it? I'm guessing not.

Ben Felix: Are you trying to bait me into giving you perspective on it?

Cameron Passmore: No, not at all. It's interesting story. Seems like a really nice guy. Lots of decent intentions. I've told other people who have asked me what I thought of it. I learned a lot, learn a lot about him, learn a lot about Coinbase. But having gone through, what is it, 17 episodes of the crypto series, it would have been really nice to have some counter arguments just to kind of challenge some of the basic beliefs and statements. That would be my main feedback, but it was well done. But it's a feel-good movie about Brian Armstrong and crypto, which is okay, but I would have liked more diverse views included. But it's a professional, like it's a real movie. It's a real thing.

Ben Felix: Yeah. I haven't watched it, and I'm not really comfortable sharing the reviews that I've read about it, but they were not very positive. But it's basically propaganda promoting Brian Armstrong.

Cameron Passmore: Right. Oh, I know. I saw the reviews. But I'm trying to, glass half full, but more challenge would have been good. Next idea. I'm in London in the middle of November, London, England. I’m looking to set up a happy hour for any listeners or people who might be interested just meeting up and chatting. If you're interested, drop me an email at cpassmore@pwlcapital.com. I’ll let you know what the plans are. That'd be kind of cool. So far, I think we have half a dozen people that want to really meet up.

Ben Felix: Really?

Cameron Passmore: Yeah.

Ben Felix: Wow.

Cameron Passmore: Yeah, just put on LinkedIn and Twitter.

Ben Felix: When is it?

Cameron Passmore: Middle of November. So it’s going to be like probably the 15th-ish. Tuesday the 15th is the date we're looking at, so it'd be like after work sometime. I'm presuming some pub somewhere, but we'll see if there's any interest first.

Ben Felix: What are you doing in London?

Cameron Passmore: Presenting at a conference? 

Ben Felix: What are you presenting on? 

Cameron Passmore: I love that surprised you.

Ben Felix: No, it’s not surprise. I’m just curious.

Cameron Passmore: I'm presenting on the impact of Rational Reminder, on our business and how that helped us, and also on our succession plan that we talked about.

Ben Felix: Interesting. Okay. Cool. 

Cameron Passmore: Yeah. Anyway, so in this week's episode, Ben, you presented the goals, research you've done, which is beautiful. We talked about the Next Millionaire Next Door, the book and discussed that. At the end, there's some pretty meaningful, impactful messages, and at the very end, there's one extremely meaningful message that we got from a listener. So pretty powerful stuff at the back end. 

Ben Felix: One? Those were all pretty deep – 

Cameron Passmore: They all were, but the last one, it's a – it's yeah, they're all pretty impactful. I agree. 

Ben Felix: Yeah. We finally did the long-awaited goals survey results. I think it's pretty cool. 

Cameron Passmore: That's a mandatory takeaway for everybody. Absolutely. When that paper is available, mandatory. 

Ben Felix: Yeah. That was a neat exercise to go through. I say it in the episode, but like, thank you, again, to people spent that hour of their time, at least, because they probably thought about it outside of actually having the browser window open to fill out the answers to respond to that. 310 people, that's a lot of people's time. 

Cameron Passmore: All right. With that, let's get to the episode.
