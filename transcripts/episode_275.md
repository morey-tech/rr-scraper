## Episode 275

Ben Felix:  This is the Rational Reminder Podcast, a weekly reality check on sensible investing and financial decision-making from two Canadians. We are hosted by me, Benjamin Felix and Cameron Passmore, Portfolio Managers at PWL Capital. 

Nick Magiulli: We have a great podcast up today. One of my favourites. I love being on earlier this year. It's the Rational Reminder Podcast with Ben Felix, Cameron Passmore, and their guest, Hal Hershfield.

Cameron Passmore: Everybody, good morning. Thanks for coming out. Super cool to be here. I want to thank John and the whole team and Advisor Circle for impeccable organization, and for inviting us. We're super excited to be here. Got a bunch of Canadians. Great to see you all here. Hope everybody got their bucket hat. So, we're going to try to do a clean recording here with Ben's traditional introduction, as you know, we’ll do a clean cut. Hopefully, it goes clean all the way through. How about we go with that, Ben? Want to start the intro, then we'll kick it off?

Ben Felix:  Yes. Sounds good. All right. This is the Rational Reminder Podcast, a weekly reality check on sensible investing and financial decision-making from two Canadians. We are hosted by me, Benjamin Felix and Cameron Passmore, Portfolio Managers at PWL Capital.

Cameron Passmore:  Welcome to Episode 273. This is a special event for us. We are live at Future Proof which is an incredible festival of professionals in the wealth management industry, down here in Huntington Beach. It is an unbelievable venue. So, we've never done a live recording before in front of an audience. And someone commented on Twitter this morning, Ben, you and I haven't recorded together since the pandemic. So, since March of 2020.

Ben Felix:  Yes, that’s right.

Cameron Passmore: As listeners know, we've announced this for a while now. We have super special guest joining us this morning, third-time guest, Hal.

Hal Hershfield: Yes, that’s right. Third time.

Cameron Passmore: So, Hal Hershfield is with us. Hal joined us in 256 earlier this summer after his fabulous book, Your Future Self was released. And he was also here in Episode 141.

Ben Felix: Yes. Hal is a Professor of Marketing Behavioural Decision Making and Psychology at UCLA. His research sits at the intersection of psychology and economics, and examines the way that we can improve our long-term decisions. Hal got his Ph.D. from Stanford University. He published in all the top academic journals, and he has just written a review paper that I don't think many people have seen

Hal Hershfield: Yes. It was really just the authors and you guys, at this point.

Ben Felix: Yes. So, we've got some very fresh research that we're going to talk about with Hal today on consumer financial decision-making. So, with that, I think we can go ahead and start talking about this research.
